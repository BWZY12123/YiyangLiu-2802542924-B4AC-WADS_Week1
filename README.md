## Article: Web Application Development & Security

Web application development focuses on building applications that run on the internet. Developers often use tools like Git and GitHub to manage code versions and collaboration.

GitHub allows developers to create repositories, track changes, and visualize project progress using branches and commits.

Security is very important in web applications. Common problems include SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Using secure coding practices and HTTPS can reduce risks.
